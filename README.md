This repository stores the practical assignments for the course 'Numerical Analysis'

There are 3 projects:

* TP1: This consists of a lineal equations solver using LU decomposition and gaussian elimination used to solve a differential equation using the finite difference method.

* TP2: Uses eigenvector power iteration method resolution to create a ranking similar to pagerank to rank soccer teams.

* TP3: Uses Splines and linear interpolation to generate slowmotion effects on videos.
